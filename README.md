# Gamify
An app I am developing to make your life an RPG so you can reach your goals and level up.

Step 1:(DONE) to make a basic UI for the user to navigate between the menus
Step 2: (DONE) I will make an andriod friendly way to save the content such as quests(to do lists) thinking .txt file
Step 3: Make a Notion inspired checklist system for the quests
Step 4: Develop the other screens to make SkillTrees and Levels that Quests contribute to
Step 5: Make a rewards system so the user can continue to motivate themselves and celebrate their acomplishments
Step 6: Refine the app further. I am think questlines that allow the user to breakdown goals into managable steps

I intend for this project to be a mental health/life admin guide that is fun to use and lets people stay of task instead of getting distracted by their phones on social media,games,etc.

In future, I may port this to a different langauge if Processing doesn't give me enough control of the phon hardware

I hope to put this on the playstore and the Apple app store if I port it to a language that allows for apple development
